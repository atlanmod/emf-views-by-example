## EMF-Views by example

This repository includes many examples of [EMF Views](https://www.atlanmod.org/emfviews/) projects organized by a increasing complexity. So, after install [Eclipse modeling bundle](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/) (or [Epsilon (<= 1.5)](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/)) and add [EMF Views through the update site](https://www.atlanmod.org/updates/emfviews/snapshot/), the examples should work without problems.

Follow the examples and the provided explanations for each of them is not enough to understand all EMF Views functionalities neither the implementation details (For it, the best resource is the EMF Views' [manual](https://www.atlanmod.org/emfviews/manual/)). However, the provided examples are a good way to discover some of the possibilities of the tool and also understand how to integrate it in a standard EMF project.

#Examples:
1. [Basic_View](/1_Basic_View/) - Basic example just to check if it's all working fine. Direct copy of tutorial
2. [View_as_Copy](/2_View_as_Copy/) - Simple examples copying features from source models to views using VPDL language
3. [View_Simple_Join_Rule](/3_View_Simple_Join_Rule/) - Using VPDL to write simple rules and combine different models into a single views
4. [View_Mixing_Models](/4_View_Mixing_Models/) - Creating views mixing different models written in different modeling languages
5. [Resources](/Resources/) - Directory to store shared resources used in all examples (models and metamodels)
